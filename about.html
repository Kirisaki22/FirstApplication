<p>The guitar is one of the most widely played instruments in the world. It is incredibly versatile and is used in many different genres of music. From Spanish flamenco and accompanying folksongs to taking the spotlight as a solo instrument in classical works, the story of the acoustic guitar mirrors that of Western music. The guitar consists of a hollow wooden body with six strings stretched over it and along a narrow neck. Guitars usually have a single, round sound hole in the body. The strings can be strummed with the fingers or plucked. Some guitarists use a plectrum (triangular piece of plastic) to sound the strings.</p>
